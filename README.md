# MVVM Architecture

- MVVM Architecture is best suited for big and complex projects.
- MVVM Architecture is advanced version of MVP Architecture.
- We can say presenter of MVP and viewmodel of MVVM is quite similar the only difference is presenter also looks after UI Updation but viewmodel has no relation with UI Stuff, ViewModel only looks after DataBinding, Validations, Business Logic.
- Presenter of MVP has 1 to 1 relation with a View. But 1 ViewModel can be mapped with many View's. Hence MVVM Architecture is considered as most segregated one and is popular among today's time.
